# EDA-on-GPU-Benchmarks.ipynb

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on GPU benchmark datasets to uncover insights into GPU performance, pricing, and graphical API scores. The aim is to preprocess, clean, merge, and analyze data to better understand GPU characteristics, trends, and performance distribution.

🔍 Objective
Analyze and compare GPU benchmarks across various performance metrics.

Understand graphical API (DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL, etc.) scores.

Examine historical price trends and relate them to performance.

Provide a foundation for visual storytelling using plots and summaries.

🗂️ Dataset Overview
Three datasets are used:

GPU_benchmarks_v7.csv – Contains GPU names with benchmark scores and performance metrics.

GPU_scores_graphicsAPIs.csv – Includes GPU scores specific to graphics APIs like DirectX, OpenCL, Vulkan.

gpu_price_history.csv – Historical price information for various GPU models.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
